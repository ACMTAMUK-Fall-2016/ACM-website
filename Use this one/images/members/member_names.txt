1 - Thomas Wurdinger - Member Since: 2016 Thomas began his computing career as a transfer student to the <a class="projects_link" href="http://www.tamuk.edu/engineering/" target="_blank">Frank H. Dotterweich College of Engineering</a> as a Computer Science undergraduate.  He quickly became enthralled with the environment, and excelled in every computer related course he could take.  Thomas plans to graduate in December of 2017 then continue his education at Texas A&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) to obtain a master's degree in Computer Science.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During his time at TAMUK, Thomas became a student member of the local chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).  He then served as Interim Chairperson during the fall semester of 2016, and Treasurer throughout 2017.  He became the lead programmer for the ACM-TAMUK's web development team in 2016 and spearheaded the creation of the site you are reading right now.
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thomas' future plans include either finding a job as a full-stack web developer or starting his own web design company.  As a student, Thomas has already designed and implemented two websites: this one, and an e-commerce site found <a target="_blank" class="projects_link" href="https://southtexasgadgets.com">here</a>.  Not only has he built those sites, but he built a secure encrypted home server using Raspberry Pi mini-computers to host them.  Thomas is a huge proponent of solar energy and DIY and feels that if you can save money by building it yourself, you should.
